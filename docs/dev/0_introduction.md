# Introduction and Usage Guide

This document provides a comprehensive set of structured prompts for building a sophisticated application using GitHub Copilot Pro in VSCode. The prompts follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and are organized into logical development phases.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Sequential Approach**: Follow the prompts in the order presented, starting with Foundation Setup and progressing through each section.

2. **TDD Workflow**: For each component:
   - First, provide the "Prompt for Test" to generate test code
   - Then, provide the "Prompt for Implementation" to implement the functionality
   - Finally, use the "Prompt for Refactoring/Optimization" when appropriate

3. **Separate Files**: Each major section is in a separate file to prevent compilation errors:
   - `1_foundation_setup.md`: Project initialization and core infrastructure
   - `2_core_components.md`: Conversation system and cognitive artifact system
   - `3_advanced_features.md`: Intellectual artifact system, agent system, and knowledge management
   - `4_integration_optimization.md`: Cross-component integration and performance optimization
   - `5_deployment_maintenance.md`: CI/CD pipeline and monitoring systems

4. **Expected Outcomes**: Each prompt includes an expected outcome to help you verify that the generated code meets requirements.

5. **Architectural Consistency**: All prompts enforce the specified architecture (DDD, Ports and Adapters, etc.) and best practices.

## Development Approach

The prompts are designed to build the application incrementally, with each component building on previously implemented functionality. The TDD approach ensures that all code is tested and meets requirements before moving to the next step.

Start with the Foundation Setup section to establish the project structure and core infrastructure, then proceed through the remaining sections in order. Each section focuses on specific aspects of the application, from core components to advanced features, integration, and finally deployment.

## Customization

Feel free to adapt the prompts to your specific needs by:
- Adjusting technical details to match your preferred tools or libraries
- Modifying the scope of specific components based on priority
- Adding domain-specific details to make the implementation more relevant to your use case

The prompts are designed to be comprehensive but can be used selectively based on your immediate development priorities.
