**SBVR Vocabulary and Rules**

| Concept Type | Term | Definition | Hierarchical Relationship |
|-------------|------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Object Types** | | | |
| | Cognitive Artifact | A dynamic thinking tool that externalizes mental processes | Parent: Artifact |
| | Intellectual Artifact | A polished knowledge product representing completed work | Parent: Artifact |
| | Agent | An AI entity with specific capabilities configured to assist with knowledge work | Parent: System Component |
| | Project | A container for related artifacts and conversations | Parent: Organization Component |
| | Conversation | A dialogue between users and AI within the system | Parent: Interaction |
| **Fact Types** | | | |
| | Cognitive Artifact evolves into Intellectual Artifact | Represents the transformation process | |
| | Agent assists with Artifact | Defines the relationship between agents and artifacts | |
| | Project contains Artifact | Establishes project ownership of artifacts | |
| | Conversation generates Cognitive Artifact | Shows origin of artifacts from dialogue | |
| **Rules** | | | |
| | It is necessary that each Cognitive Artifact is associated with at least one Project | Ensures proper organization | |
| | It is necessary that each Agent has defined capabilities and permissions | Ensures proper agent configuration | |
| | It is necessary that version history is maintained for each Artifact | Ensures traceability | |
| | It is possible that a Cognitive Artifact is transformed into an Intellectual Artifact | Defines transformation potential | |
| | It is necessary that each User has authorized access to Projects they work with | Ensures proper access control | |
