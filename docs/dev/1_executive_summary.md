# Software Design Specification (SDS)
# Cognitive Workspace: AI-Enhanced Knowledge Work Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The Cognitive Workspace system is designed to transform knowledge work by providing an AI-powered environment where thinking processes are externalized through dynamic cognitive artifacts that evolve into polished intellectual outputs.
